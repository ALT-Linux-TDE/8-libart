 libart-lgpl - a 2D graphics library


Libart-lgpl is a library of functions for 2D graphics supporting a
superset of the PostScript imaging model, designed to be integrated with
graphics, artwork and illustration programs.
It is written in optimized C and is fully compatible with C++.
With a small footprint of 10,000 lines of code, it is especially suitable
for embedded applications.



======================================================================

NOTE: The TDE project has taken over maintenance of this library,
starting with the sources from the final upstream release v2.3.21.

This allows the TDE project to resolve remaining issues that cause
problems or crashes within TDE.

This patched library is only available under the terms of the
GPL/LGPL, and is NOT for sale by the original author as mentioned
above, as patch copyright has NOT been transferred to the original
author and we have no plans to do so.
